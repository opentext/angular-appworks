# Ng-Appworks

This Angular Library for Appworks needs to be built with Angular CLI version 6.0.0.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install ng-appworks --save
```
```typescript
import {NgAppworksModule, NgAppworks} from 'ng-appworks';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    NgAppworksModule,
    ...
  ],
  providers: [NgAppworks]
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
Then you just have to inject to where you need it:

```typescript
import {  NgAppworks  } from 'ng-appworks';

@Component({...})
export class YourComponent {
  constructor(protected appworks: NgAppworks) {
    this.auth = new appworks.AWAuth(...)
  }

}
```
